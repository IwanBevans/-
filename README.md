TODO List:
PK - Create profile selection screen

Ideas for extra features:
- Having different types of tiles/enemies.
- Saving the inventory and where player is on the map.
- A tile that launches you forwards until you hit a wall.
- Bring up inventory mid game

How to use GitHub: 
Firstly download git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Getting started:
1) Open command prompt
2) Change directory to where you want the repository (using cd [directory] or cd ..)
3) Use the command below to copy the repository into your directory (I think you have to do this everytime someone makes a change)
            git clone https://github.com/IwanBevans/- 
4) Use 'git status' to track any changes you have made

To upload a changed file
1) Use 'git add [file]' to upload the file to the repo, then check the changes using 'git status'
2) Commit the changes: git commit -m "message here"
3) Then push the changes (uploades them to GitHub): git push

To delete a file:
git rm file1.txt
git commit -m "remove file1.txt"
git push
